# Project Overview

This project is an abstracted NestJS module designed to simplify the integration of Google Tag Manager API into various applications. It provides a set of utilities and services that allow developers to easily manage tags and triggers without dealing with the complexities of API requests and response handling.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- NestJS - https://docs.nestjs.com/ 
- Google Tag Manager API - https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/api/v2

## Important Considerations
